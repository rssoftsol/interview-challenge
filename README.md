# code-challenge-3

Java app which takes the str parameter, which will contain single digit numbers, letters, 
and question marks, and checks if there are exactly 3 question marks between every pair of two numbers that add up to 10.
If so, then program returns true, otherwise it returns false. If there aren't any two numbers that adds up to 10 in the string, then program will return false.
For example: if str is "arrb6???4xxbl5???eee5" then program will return true because there are exactly 3 question marks between 6 and 4, and 3 question marks between 5 and 5 at the end of the string.
